Dear {{name}},
 
This Monday, you are going to vote in the ITRE committee on the proposal on a "Telecom Single Market" regulation.
Please vote for the alternative CA 4 B by Catherine Trautmann to save the open internet and reject the CA 4 A by Rapporteur Pilar del Castillo!
 
The decisions that you and your colleagues will make this week will have a lasting impact on the open internet in Europe. Itâ€™s critical to get this right and not accept bad compromises.
 
The report proposed by the Rapporteur Pilar del Castillo is very unclear and contains many loopholes that would put the open interenet in danger.
The alternative compromise amendment from Catherine Trautmann (S&amp;D) clarifies the text, makes for example by providing a binding definition of net neutrality. 
 
Ms Trautmann's definition of "specialised services" is tighter and prevents incumbent companies (Facebook, Google, Apple) from closing down competition by offering their services on the fast lane as a "specialised service". 
 
Neither text is perfect, but Ms Trautmann's proposal is significantly better and offers highest safeguard for the open internet. 
Please don't jeopardize the future of the internet in Europe and vote for the alternative compromise CA 4 B! 
 
The open Internet is a huge asset for our society and our economy. It must be saved from measures aimed at protecting monopolies. Save it now!!
 
Sincerely,
a concerned citizen
