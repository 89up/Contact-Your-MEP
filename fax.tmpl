Dear {{name}},

The ITRE Committee will be voting on the Commission proposal for a Telecom Single Market on February 24th.

As a citizen of the EU, I am very concerned that some of the draft provisions will not achieve the meaningful protections for net neutrality that the Commission was aiming for. On the contrary, the current draft would lead to limited possibilities of accessing Internet content and services. Therefore, please take into account that:

Article 2.15 of the draft text leaves the door open for a two-tiered Internet by allowing ISPs to prioritised certain services while others would be pushed into a slow lane. As a consequence,  the freedom of expression would be restricted, innovation would be stifled and StartUps in Europe would suffer a significant disadvantage to companies in the USA. In order to introduce legal clarity, please support an amendment to this definition that is brought in line with that of BEREC.

Furthermore, the current draft gives users the "freedom" to enter into agreements with ISPs. This "freedom" will not benefit the users but it will actually empower ISPs to offer a wide variety of confusing services which might lead to discrimination. You can easly fix this problem by changing "freedom" for "rights" in the whole proposal. 

Finally, in order to remain consistent with the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights, it is essential to remove references allowing ISPs to implement voluntary measures to "prevent or impede serious crime" in Article 23.5. If illegal content is found online, ISPs have to act following a court order, in line with the rule of law.

I hope that my input will be helpful and remain at your disposal.

Yours sincerely,
a concerned citizen
