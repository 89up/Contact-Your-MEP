Dear {{name}},
 
On March 18th, you are going to vote in the ITRE committee on the proposal on a "Telecom Single Market" regulation. There are still dangerous loopholes in the compromise texts. 

After the vote was postponed in February, the Committee's decision will be watched even more closely by the public. You have the chance to make a lasting impact on the free and open internet in Europe. Itâ€™s critical to get this right and not accept bad compromises.

The remaining loopholes in the text are: 

* The definition of "specialised services" in Article 2.15 needs to cover online services as well as access services. Existing online services, or functionally identical services to them, should be prevented from creating a competitively destructive fast lane online. 
* The first sentence of Article 23.5. severely restricts the non-discrimination principle, as it only covers activities that are within "contractually agreed limits". This would allow ISPs to discriminate outside (potentially very low) data caps and undermine the open internet, affecting millions of users and businesses. 
* The principle of "net neutrality" as defined in Recital 45 has to be binding in the legislation. Users need a guarantee for net neutrality against discrimination of their ISPs. 

We need to get this right. A small amount of loopholes that undermine the open internet is the same as a large number of loopholes that undermine the open internet. ISPs have proven their determination to establish themselves as gatekeepers of online services for their own short-term interests and against the interests of their users and the digital economy in Europe. It is now up to you to ensure that competition, innovation and free expression can thrive in the EU.

There is no need to "swap" roaming for net neutrality; we can have both. The roaming problem was created by the "sending-party-pays" market model of mobile telephony. Rejecting net neutrality means creating the same market model for the internet! This must not be allowed to happen.
 
Sincerely,
A concerned citizen
