Dear {{name}},
 
The ITRE Committee will soon be voting on the Commission proposal for the completion of the digital single market. This is a unique opportunity for MEPs to defend European citizens’ rights to freedom of communication.
 
As a citizen of the EU, I am very concerned that some of the draft provisions are not yet drafted well enough to achieve the meaningful protections for net neutrality that the Commission was aiming for. On the contrary, the current draft would lead to limited possibilities of accessing Internet content and services and would therefore restrict the freedom of communication and have a negative impact on innovation and competition. Please take into account: 

There are numerous examples of undefined qualifiers (“substantially”, “in general” and “widely”) which have no obvious meaning and will generate new barriers and new legal uncertainty. For instance, Article 23 of the draft text leaves the door open for a two-tiered Internet by allowing ISPs to offer speeds at different rates through weakly defined “specialised services” that offer “a defined quality of service or dedicated capacity.” It would allow special deals as long as they do not "substantially" impair the general quality of internet access services and as long as they are not “widely used as a substitute for internet access service". In order to establish legal certainty, I am asking you to remove "substantially" from Recital 50 and to delete "widely" from Article 2 (15).
 
Furthermore, the current draft would allow discriminatory agreements between access and content providers as long as they do not “impair in a recurring or continuous manner the general quality of internet access services". This provision lacks clarity, I therefore suggest to delete the word "general".
 
The Commission proposal also foresees a broad and ill-defined range of exceptions to the prohibition of discriminatory measures (see article 23 (5) – a to d).
In addition, I propose to amend the definition of "specialised service" to ensure that the definition covers only services which are not run over the public Internet. I propose to delete from article 23.1 "and, in accordance with any such agreements relative to data volumes, to avail of any offers by providers of internet content, applications and services".

Finally, it is quite clear that any legal obligations imposed on access providers by the courts would not be at all relevant to the subject matter of the Regulation. Therefore, and also to remain consistent with Article 52 of the European Charter on Fundamental Rights, it is essential to remove references to interferences with Internet traffic for public policy reasons. The text should be replaced with a clearer text specifying that legally mandated interferences do not constitute “traffic management” within the context of the Regulation.
 
I  hope that my input will be helpful and remain at your disposal.
 
Yours sincerely,
  A concerned Citizen
