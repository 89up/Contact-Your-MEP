Dear {{name}},

I'm asking you to save net neutrality again. 

In April 2014 the European Parliament adopted a strong position net neutrality in the Telecom Single Market regulation. I call on you to defend this decision in the interest of the European population and to not let your position be watered down in the current trialogue negotiations. 

The driving force for diversity, innovation and growth in the online economy is net neutrality. This founding principle of the internet is what guarantees European innovation and human rights online. 

I am glad the text is trying to get rid of roaming charges, but ask you not to forget about net neutrality. Let's not forget that many of the same companies that have abused roaming charges for many years are the same ones being offered loopholes to abuse with regard to net neutrality. 

Today, internet users can access content from big companies and small blogs, news sites or government websites on an equal basis. But if clear rules enshrining net neutrality and outlawing network discrimination are not included, ISPs will be able to create fast lanes where few companies would get prioritised access to customers, leaving smaller websites, education and civic services, and anyone else who can't pay, in the slow lane. As telecoms operators would be empowered to hand pick the winners and losers in thie market, this would begin a new era of online discrimination and the establishment of an anti-competitive protectionist market in the EU.

In 2014, the European Parliament stood with thousands of citizens who took action to fight for net neutrality in the European Parliament. More than 40,000 faxes, thousands of emails, and hundreds of phone calls were sent to defend our fundamental rights online. I'm asking you to stand with me again. 

Right now, it is up to you to ensure citizens' fundamental rights and the prosperity and competitiveness of the EU internal market by taking a strong stance in favour of net neutrality. 

Sincerely,
A concerned citizen
